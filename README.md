# Changing The DOM With Tools and JavaScript

## Problem Statement

1. Demonstrate viewing the DOM through Chrome DevTools
2. Select an element with Chrome DevTools
3. Delete an element with Chrome DevTools and the Keyboard / Mouse
4. Demonstrate that the source is not changed when the DOM is
5. Demonstrate opening the DevTools' JavaScript console
5. Select an element with JavaScript
6. Delete an element with JavaScript
7. Demonstrate that the source is not changed when the DOM is

## Introduction
In this lab, we're going to change the DOM in two ways. First, we'll
use Chrome's Developer Tools ("DevTools") and our mouse to remove an element
from the DOM. Then we'll use the DevTools' JavaScript console to run JavaScript that does the same thing.


## Instructions

## Conclusion

DOM programming is using JavaScript to:

1. Ask the DOM to find or `select` an HTML element or elements in the rendered page
2. Remove the selected elements and/or insert a new element
3. Adjust a property of the selected element(s)


In this lesson you just did all that stuff! Learning to duplicate what you can
do in DevTools with JavaScript **is** DOM programming. The next lessons are
going to give you `methods` for selecting elements and changing them, but you
just changed the DOM. High fives are in order.
